# Notflix (a Netflix Clone) 

[Click here for the Deployed Demo](http://notflix.surge.sh/)

This project is a clone of Netflix's frontend that also persists user data for login and keeping track of favorite movies/tv shows. [Backend Repo here](https://github.com/larrysass/notflix-backend)

It was built using React and vanilla CSS. It uses [The MovieDB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) to find movies and display details.

### User Stories: 
-The user can sign up and log in, and save their favorite movies/tv shows to their list
-The user can click on a details button to see its plot overview and watch its trailer
-The user can click on a "see more movies like this" button to see similar titles
-The user can search for movies
